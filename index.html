                    editing the photos to bring out the colors more and give the picture more beauty.</p>

                <p>Being outside is amazing! During the summers I am always out playing basketball in my
                free time and in the winters I am up in the mountains snowboarding with my friends. In the winter image
                below that's me(right) and my brother(left) going up the ski lift at Brighton. The other two images are from
                when I went to Moab, Utah and saw all the arches and went to Canyonlands.</p>
